This is a basic website which is made using three js and I typically wanted to learn three js so here I am :) and you can just clone the project run the index.html in the browser and boom there is a tree there
The installation is very simple just clone and ding! But still for the nerd out there, yes you who is here should have npm and and run the following command :- npm install --save three and done :)
For futher information go check out the website for the documentation :- https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene
